# Final Project - Recipe Book

Submitted by: Nora Fotoohi

Recipe Book is an app that keeps track of a list of recipes that the user inputs. The app also holds a check list of ingredients for each recipe, a list of instructions, and pictures of the dish. The user can create, edit, or delete individual recipes, as well as organize and categorize the recipes however they want. The user can even create a 'menu' that will include all selected recipes that the user wants and will create a complete ingredient list for all the recipes in the 'menu'.
