## New App Ideas - Initial Brainstorming
1. Plant Tracker
   - This app will keep track of all the plants that the user wants to and will give instructions on how to care for said plants. The user can add the plants to their "garden", and can receive care instructions and certain facts about the plant as well as what other plants work well in the same environment as the plant.
2. Trivia Game
   - This app is a gaming app where the user can choose to answer trivia questions of their own making or from a Trivia API. The user can add any questions they want, with any category they want. They can also sort their questions by category, or type, and adjust how many questions they get per round.
3. Show Journal
   - This app can keep track of all the shows that the user has watched, all the user has to do is add the show to their list. They can also keep track of how many seasons the show has and how many episodes each season has, as well as keeping track of which episode they have watching in order to track their progess. The user can then rate the show, the season, and the episode as well as adding notes for each one so that the user can explain what they liked or disliked about the episode, season, or show.
4. Recipe Book
   - This app will hold your recipes in a neat list that the user can organize to their wants and needs. The user can upload new recipes with an ingredients list, a picture of the finished dish, and instructions of how to make it. If the user wants, they can add photos of what the dish looks like during the cooking process, along with a list of the necessary equipment to make the dish.
5. Homework Tracker
   - This app is a list app that will keep track of the user's assignments and homework. The user can add a homework assignmnet, assign a class and date to the assignmnet, and will be able to add extra notes and a personal checklist of steps to complete the assignments. The assignments will be shown to the user in a list format organized by due date, and the user can check off or delete an assignment if and when they finish. The user can also rate the difficulty of the assignment, and will be able to change the organization by date, difficulty, class, or name.


## Top 3 App Ideas - Evaluation
### Trivia Game
   - **Category:** 
   - **Mobile:** 
   - **Story:** 
   - **Market:** 
   - **Habit:** 
   - **Scope:**
### Recipe Book
   - **Category:** Utility / Food
   - **Mobile:** This app includes photos that the user can take themselves and upload or upload from their camera roll.
   - **Story:** The app allows users to keep track of their favorite recipes and tweak them easily in one place. 
   - **Market:** Anyone who likes to cook and likes to keep track of what they cook and how would like this app. This could have a huge market for people who enjoy cooking. 
   - **Habit:** This app isn't very habit forming, since it is only for tracking use and not for anything social or entertainment related. 
   - **Scope:** I think that I can complete the basic functions of the app, with adding, deleting, and editing individual recipes. But I would need more time to create the other features that I want such as, ingredient check list, photos to show the final product or progress, grouping the recipes, creating and menu with selected recipes that will show a whole ingredient list for the entire menu. 
### Show Journal
   - **Category:** Entertainment / Utility
   - **Mobile:** This app is more organized and secure than a website.
   - **Story:** The app allows its users to track and record their progress in watching shows.
   - **Market:** Anyone who is watching multiple shows on multiple different streaming sites and apps and wishes to have a place to keep track of all their show watching progress. 
   - **Habit:** This app is not very habit forming as it is only used for tracking and updating progress. 
   - **Scope:** I believe that I can finish the basic function of the app in time. But I would need more time in order to implement the extra elements of this app, such as easy show search up from API, nested shows to season to episode, rating and notes for each, categorizing.
